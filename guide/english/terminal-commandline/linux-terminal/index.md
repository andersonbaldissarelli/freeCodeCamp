Most users prefer to interact with the system through the graphical interface, but this presents many limitations when it comes to changes that the user can make in the system. For the user to get out of this limitation and have full control there is a powerful tool called terminal, also known as command line or shell. The Linux terminal allows the user to make advanced changes to the system through root access, when a user becomes root means that he becomes superuser or system administrator.
